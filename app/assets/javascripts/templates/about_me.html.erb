          <p>I am a developer who enjoys the struggle of learning a new topic as much as completing a task I've done many times before.  I graduated from Turing School of Software and Design in March and am activly looking to join a team where I can progress all of my programming knowledge and give me the opportunity to learn all about production applications.</p>
          <p>Having the ability to make something or complete a new task during your day is a great skill to have.  I moved into the web development career so I could explore the possiblilities computers.  Developing has become an awesome part of my life and I embrace the fact that the learning is never really done in a business that is constantly changing.</p>

      <p>I moved to Denver after I graduated college in Vermont and worked as an EMT and Phlebotomist.  Coming from the medical world into web development was a fairly big change, but one that I welcomed.  Programming has always been an interest of mine, although it was not until I came to Denver that I realized how much really goes into web development.</p>

      <p>Having only worked with a few languages and web tools for about a year, I know how much more there is to learn.  I made this website to possibly help anyone who stumbles on it with some of the problems I have run into while programming.</p>
