          <p>I am a developer who enjoys learning new topics as much as completing a task I've done many times before.  I graduated from Turing School of Software and Design in Denver, CO and now I am actively looking to join a team where I can keep progressing all of my programming knowledge, while having the opportunity to learn and work on production applications.</p>
          <p>I left the medical field in search of a career that would challenge me to find answers to difficult problems and give me the freedom of creation.  Programming has given me just that, a skill that allows me to solve problems and build really cool things.  Web Development has become an enormous part of my life over the last year and I am excited to keep moving forward.</p>

      <p>I moved to Colorado after graduating from a small college in northern Vermont.  While in VT I worked as an EMT and Phlebotomist.  Coming from the medical world to web development was a fairly big change, but one I welcomed.  Programming has always been an interest of mine, although it was not until I came to CO that I realized how much really goes into web development.</p>

      <p>Having only worked with a few languages and web tools for about a year, I know how much more there is to learn.  I was able to figure out a lot of the problems I came upon in my code through the help of blogs and tutorials, so I made this website to possibly help anyone who finds it while facing some of the problems I ran into while programming.</p>
