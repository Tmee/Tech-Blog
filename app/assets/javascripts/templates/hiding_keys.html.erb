## Using Figaro


```bash
figaro install
```

This is the file that was created when you entered ``` figaro install ``` earlier.

In app/config/application.yml add the following code.

```ruby
mandrill_key: "your_mandrill_api_key"
mandrill_email: "your_registered_mandrill_email"
```

Add the API key you made on the Mandrill website where it says "your_mandrill_api_key"
Now we can go back to app/config/application.rb, where we were setting the smtp settings.  Figaro makes keeping the api secret by adding a variable into the ENV hash.  We can access that API key you set to ``` mandrill_key ``` by ``` ENV["mandrill_key"] ```.  After adding the mandrill key to the config file it should look something like this:

```ruby
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp

config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
  address:              'smtp.mandrillapp.com',
  port:                 '587',
  user_name:            ENV["mandrill_email"],
  password:             ENV["mandrill_key"],
  authentication:       'plain',
  enable_starttls_auto: true
}
```
